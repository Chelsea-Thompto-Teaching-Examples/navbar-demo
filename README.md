# Navigation Bar Demo

## Overview

Basic navigation bar demo using only HTML and CSS. Pages show a few simple ways to style navigation elements.

## HTML

The navigation bar consists of a <nav> tag with <h1> and <a> tags inside. The <nav> is given a class to aid in styling which is defined in the style.css file. A different class is used for each page so that the rules (and resulting navigation bar layout) are different for each page. The title of the page is given the <h1> tag and the links to the other pages use the <a> tags. Relative linking is used to move between the pages. For more information on relative linking, check my "Basic Website Architecture" example which can be found here:

## CSS

The navigation is placed in the top center, left, or right hand sides by defining the margin, text-align, padding and position. Check the class rules in the CSS, which all start with a period, that match the class name in the HTML to see how a given position is accomplished.
